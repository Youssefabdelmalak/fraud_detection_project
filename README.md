Fraud Detection Project
Project Overview

The Fraud Detection Project aims to identify fraudulent transactions in financial datasets using machine learning techniques. The main objective is to develop models that can accurately distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent transactions, reducing false positives and improving detection rates. The project explores data preprocessing, feature engineering, handling class imbalance, and comparing multiple machine learning models to achieve optimal performance.

Summary of Results

Models Tested: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, [add any other models used]

Best Performing Model: [Insert model name, e.g., XGBoost]

Evaluation Metrics:

Precision: [value]

Recall: [value]

F1-score: [value]

ROC-AUC: [value]

The project demonstrates that [brief summary, e.g., “XGBoost achieves the highest accuracy and recall, making it most suitable for fraud detection in imbalanced datasets”].
